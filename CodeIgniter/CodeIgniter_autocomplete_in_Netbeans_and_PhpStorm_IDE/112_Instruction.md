###### CodeIgniter Autocomplete

Codeigniter is a great framework for php . 
It is simple and already helps lot of people to write faster code. 
The documentation is very good with examples for all the classes – functions.

But (there is always a but…!) in eclipse we used to have our own classes and when we write the “magic arrow” -> we are waiting 
to have a dropdown list with the functions/variables that the class have .

In Codeigniter till now we write for example $this->session-> … and then we go to the codeigiter website just to see what was the name of the function .

For that reason I created a fake Controller. This is only a fake Controller and it used ONLY for the autocomplete. You can copy paste it WHEREVER you like in the project (because is fake).

Ok lets see it how it works .

**1st Step**

Download the zip file :

[Download the zip file for CI 2.x (recommended)] (https://github.com/scoumbourdis/codeigniter-autocomplete/archive/master.zip)

or

[Download the zip file for CI 1.7.x] (http://www.web-and-development.com/downloads/fakeController.zip)

or

Download the latest development edition from github repository: https://github.com/scoumbourdis/codeigniter-autocomplete 

**2nd Step**

Copy it somewhere in your project (I’ve copy it into libraries in a folder named fake)

**3rd Step**

Start typing in your Controller :-). That’s it. Pretty easy right? Below there are some images to show what you are be able to do.

It works fine in eclipse,netbeans,phpstorm and Aptana.

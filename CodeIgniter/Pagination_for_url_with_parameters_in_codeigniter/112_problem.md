we have an application which has page's result on the bases of certain parameters like domain.com/index.php/welcome/student/male 
here welcome is controller student is method name male is parameter, 
now we want pagination for this, but the problem is a person can also use sub category like this 
domain.com/index.php/welcome/student/male/steven where steven is another parameter, 
how to create pagination for this type of urls. Thank you in advance :)

###### This Gist uses DataTables Jquery Plugin
###### Website Address: http://datatables.net/ 
Note: This gist does all crud(create, read, update, delete) operation in one controller function.
      Controller function uses switch statment to separate add/edit/save/delete operation.
      Data grid is separate page and Form is separate page. Here is separate view option in Form.
      Data grid is Not Ajax based. Model is used. Helper is used.

###### Configuring experimental performance tweaks

**Which experimental performance tweaks would like to enable?**

- [ ] Enable file system caching

    File system data will be read in bulk and cached in memory for certain operations 
    ("core.fscache" is set to "true"). This provides a significant performance boost
    (experimental).

###### Adjusting your PATH environment

**How would you like to use Git from the command line?**

- [ ] Use Git from Git Bash only

    This is the safest choice as your PATH will not be modified at all. You will
    only be able to use the Git command line tools from Git Bash.
- [ ] Use Git from the Windows Command Prompt

    This option is considered safe as it only adds some minimal Git wrappers to your PATH to avoid
    cluttering your environment with optional Unix tools. You will be able to use Git from both
    Git Bash and the Windows Command Prompt.
- [ ] Use Git and optional Unix tools from the Windows Command Prompt

    Both Git and the optional Unix tools will be added to your PATH.
    Warnings: This will override Windows tools like "find" and "sort". Only use this option if you
    understand the implications.

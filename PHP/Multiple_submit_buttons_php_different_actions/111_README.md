## Multiple submit buttons php different actions

Note: Question: What if the user just hits the Enter key without clicking on any submit button?
      Answer: Unless you change it, it will submit the form with whatever action it has by default. 
      If that's not what you want, you can set up whatever behavior you want via an onsubmit listener 
      on the <form> element.
